# Getting Started with Creating a React Drummachine

Inspired by the Roland TR-808 I want to create a unique Drummachine, with multiply parameters to change and shape each sound in a unique way. The Drummachine should be a powerful tool for creating music.

Following Sounds should be integrated:

- Bass
- BassDrum
- SnareDrum
- LowTom
- MidTom
- HighTom
- Clap
- RimShot
- Closed HiHat
- Open HiHat
- Ride

Each Sound should have following parameter to tweak and adjust:

- Volume
- Pitch
- Decay
- Filter
